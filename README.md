# Spelling Error Detection and Correction System 
The code I provided are a Flask application written in Python and ·ä£
It includes route handlers, form handling, and rendering HTML templates using Jinja template engine. 

Previous attempts are not made to develop a spell checker for Guragee  . Previous works have attempted 
to use existing approaches likes metaphone and edit distance algorithms. However, these 
approaches are designed for languages which have a simple morphology like English. Moreover, 
unlike Gurage, in other languages distance between words is not dependent on the family and 
order of characters. As a result, using these approaches for a language with complex morphology 
like Gurage will not give the anticipated result. Similarly, using existing morphological analyzers 
for computational morphology is attempted in other works. . 
Accordingly, this study attempts to investigate the possibility of using morphology-based approach 
to design and develop an guragee typing error detection and correction system for non-word 
errors.
