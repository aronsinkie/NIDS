# Spelling Error Detection and Correction System 

This study aims to develop a Guragee spell checker that takes into account the complex morphology of the Gurage language.
Previous attempts using approaches like metaphone and edit distance algorithms, designed for simpler languages like English, 
did not yield satisfactory results for Gurage. Similarly, existing morphological analyzers were not suitable for computational morphology in Gurage. 
Therefore, this study explores the possibility of using a morphology-based approach to design and develop a Guragee typing error detection and correction system specifically targeting non-word errors.

 The code I provided leverages Flask to create a web application with route handling, form processing, and HTML template rendering using Jinja.
- *The code is a Flask application written in Python(app.y).*
- *It utilizes a SQL database(spellcheckersql.py).*
- *The application includes route handlers to handle different URL endpoints and execute corresponding functions(@app.route('/spellcheck', methods=['POST'])in app.py.*
- *Form handling is implemented to process user input from HTML forms.*
- *The Jinja template engine is used to render dynamic HTML templates by filling in data placeholders with Python code.*
